# What is docker?

Docker is a **container** technology: A tool for creating and managing containers.

> **Container:**
> A standarized unit of software
> A package of **code** **and** **dependancies** to run that code _(e.g. NodeJS code + NodeJS runtime)_

> The same container always yields the **exact same application and execution behavior!** No matter where or by whom it might be executed.
